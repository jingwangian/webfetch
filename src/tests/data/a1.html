                    Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has called the strikes "unnecessary"

        </figure><p>Chief executive Michael O'Leary said the company had written to unions offering to move all staff to local contracts, which made the strike action "unnecessary".</p><p>However, the Dutch pilots union said it had only verbally offered its members local contracts and had refused to put the offer in writing. </p><p>Joost Van Doesburg, of the VNV union, said his members also wanted pensions in line with Dutch standards, and firmer guarantees on sick pay.</p><p>The German pilots' union said it could not rule out further strikes.</p><hr class="story-body__line"/><h2 class="story-body__crosshead">Analysis: </h2><p><strong>Tom Burridge, BBC transport correspondent</strong></p><p>Meet with Michael O'Leary and beyond the bullish facade, this multi-faceted dispute is more complex and potentially damaging than he is willing to let on. </p><p>The roots of today's row stretch back to autumn last year when Ryanair 400,000 Ryanair passengers had their flights cancelled.</p><p>The airline did not have enough pilots to honour its schedule. It was in Mr O'Leary's words "a mess of our own making". </p><p>The subsequent decision to start recognising pilot and cabin crew unions around Europe was a multinational can-of-worms. </p><p>Some deals with some unions in some countries have been done. </p><p>But overall there is plenty to resolve and incendiary language, on both sides, is the flavour of the day.</p><hr class="story-body__line"/><h2 class="story-body__crosshead">Social rights</h2><p>Ryanair this week signed deals with cabin crew unions in Italy to provide employment contracts under Italian law and agreed to arbitration with the union representing its German pilots.</p><p>The European Commission said Ryanair employees should have contracts in the countries where they live rather than in Ireland, where its planes are registered.</p><p>EU social affairs commissioner Marianne Thyssen told Mr O'Leary at a meeting in Brussels on Wednesday that EU rules on employment of air crews were based on where workers left in the morning and returned in the evening - and not where aircraft were registered.</p><p>"Respecting EU law is not something over which workers should have to negotiate, nor is it something which can be done differently from country to country," Ms Thyssen said.</p><p>"The internal market is not a jungle - it has clear rules on fair labour mobility and worker protection. This is not an academic debate, but about concrete social rights of workers."</p><figure class="media-landscape has-caption full-width">

They will be the first in the country since it closed Marseille in early 2011 after being sued for employing French workers on Irish contracts.</p><p>It will also open another base at Bordeaux for summer 2019 and had another four under consideration.</p><p>Two aircraft will be based at both Marseille and Bordeaux and will offer a total of 64 routes and handle 3.5 million passengers a year.</p>
